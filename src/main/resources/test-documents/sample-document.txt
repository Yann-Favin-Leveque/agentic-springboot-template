Product Documentation: AgentService Template

Overview:
The Spring Boot AgentService Template is a production-ready starter for building AI-powered applications.
It uses the agentic-helper library with AgentService for multi-LLM orchestration.

Key Features:
- Multi-instance support: Configure multiple OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Azure Anthropic deployments
- Rate limiting: Built-in token bucket algorithm prevents API rate limit errors
- Structured outputs: Type-safe JSON responses with automatic schema generation
- Conversation management: Multi-turn conversations with automatic history
- Autonomous agents: Tool execution loop with reflection between calls
- Async execution: CompletableFuture-based for high performance
- Direct model usage: Use any model without agent registration

Supported Models:
- GPT-4o: Latest flagship model for complex reasoning
- GPT-4o-mini: Fast and cost-effective for most tasks
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: Advanced reasoning via Azure Anthropic
- Text-embedding-3-small: 1536-dimension embeddings for semantic search
- DALL-E 3: High-quality image generation

Configuration:
Set up your environment with LLM_INSTANCES JSON array in .env file.
Each instance requires: id, url, key, models, provider, and apiVersion (for Azure).

Rate Limiting:
Configure LLM_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND (default: 2) and LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS (default: 20) in .env file.

Best Practices:
- Use structured outputs for data extraction and classification
- Implement proper error handling with retry logic
- Clean up conversations after use (deleteConversation)
- Monitor rate limits and adjust configuration as needed
